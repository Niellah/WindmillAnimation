Windmill Animation
This project demonstrates how to create a windmill animation using JavaScript. It creates a simple windmill with four blue blades that rotate smoothly.

Description
The animation is created dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation. The windmill consists of a central hub and four blades. Each blade is positioned and rotated using CSS styling.

Usage
To use this animation, simply include the index.js file in your HTML document. The animation will automatically start when the page loads.

Example
You can see the windmill animation in action by opening the HTML file included in this project in a web browser.
